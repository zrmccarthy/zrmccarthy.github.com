			<h1>Girl Talk Infograph</h1><br>
				<p>Girl Talk, as I'm sure whoever is reading this probably already knows, is a DJ that mixes and mashes a wide variety of popular songs, oldies, and everything in between to create some interesting songs. The purpose of this infograph was to find a way to visually present one of his songs in the form of data, and find a unique aspect of his work to present rather than just what songs were mixed together.I chose to work with what WASN'T included in the mash-ups. The amount of layers in his work is amazing. Besides the multiple layers of songs, he takes specific parts of these songs. For example, he will take just the vocals of one song, just the beat of another song, and just the guitar from another one. This graph is meant to clearly show what specific instruments are playing during what time in the song.</p><br>
